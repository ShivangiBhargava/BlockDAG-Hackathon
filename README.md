# Welcome to Sherlock AI - DeFi's AI Powered Transaction Explainer project

## Project info

**URL**: https://sherlock-ai-transaction-explainer.lovable.app/


Product Description -

**What it does?**

Sherlock AI is an intelligent transaction assistant that decodes complex blockchain activity into plain English, helping users understand exactly what they have signed such as risky, safe transactions. Built for BlockDAG’s EVM-compatible ecosystem, it combines large language models (LLMs) with real-time on-chain analysis to analyze DeFi.  

**Why it matters on L1?**

Layer 1 (L1) blockchains are crucial because they form the foundational layer of the entire blockchain ecosystem, providing the core security, decentralization, and transaction processing capabilities. With BlockDAG's growing ecosystem, there's an urgent need for AI-powered, user-friendly transaction security analysis that can prevent losses and build user confidence.

**Who benefits?**

Target Segments - 
• DeFi users (50M+ globally)
• Blockchain developers
• Security researchers
• Institutional investors

**Unique BlockDAG-specific advantages?**

Consensus, Speed, Data Availability, etc.

**How Sherlock AI Works?**

1. Paste a TX Hash.  
   - Sherlock fetches the transaction from BlockDAG’s testnet.  

2. AI-Powered Analysis  
   - An LLM (e.g., GPT-4) analyze:  
     - Token swaps  
     - Contract approvals   
     - Scam alerts (e.g., "This address is linked to a known drainer!")  

3. User-Friendly Output 
   - Clear summaries + emoji warnings ( Safe / Medium Risk / High Risk)  
  
Key Features:

✅ Plain-English Explanations – No more decoding calldata.  
✅ Gas Fee Optimization – Suggests cheaper times to transact on BlockDAG.  
✅ Multichain Support – Works on BlockDAG + Ethereum, BSC, etc. 

**Why BlockDAG?**

- EVM Compatibility – Easy integration with existing tools (Hardhat).  
- Scalability – Faster, cheaper transactions than Ethereum L1.  
- Focus – Showcasing BlockDAG’s developer-friendly infrastructure.
  
Technical Stack:

React, TypeScript, JavaScript, Solidity, CSS, HTML, Node.js + LLM API (OpenAI), Blockchain technology, BlockDAG RPC   

**Why Sherlock AI?**

✔ Technical Excellence – LLM + smart contract parsing.  
✔ BlockDAG Integration – Uses testnet RPC/APIs.  
✔ Innovation – First AI-native tx explainer for BlockDAG.  
✔ UX/UI – Clean, intuitive, responsive and mobile-friendly.  
✔ Real-World Impact – Could prevent millions in losses.  

In short, Sherlock AI is like a cybersecurity expert + cryptographer in your pocket—translating blockchain transactions into plain English and saving users from costly mistakes.
